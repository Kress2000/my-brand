- This is my website being built by only HTML5, CSS3 AND JS. It is made by such stacks as suggested by [@andela](https://github.com/andela).
- I plan to make it a full-stack web app with mongoBd on the back-end and Express library. I will also use mongoose, and JWT.
- After this, it will be a full web app.
